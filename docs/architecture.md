# Architecture Guide

This document outlines the core architecture, data flow, and design principles behind `onepfp`.

1. **Express API Server (`server.cjs` / `routes/`):**
   - Handles client registration, login, JWT token issuance, and session generation.
   - Generates secure presigned S3 URLs containing combined user, session, and image IDs as the storage key.
2. **Oracle Database:**
   - Serves as the primary data store for users, user session mappings, and upload states.
   - Tracks image upload status (`pending` initially, updated to `completed` upon successful upload).
   - Tracks the active profile picture mapping for each user in the `active` table.
3. **Amazon S3:**
   - Stores raw profile images securely. It processes direct-to-S3 uploads, avoiding load on backend nodes.
4. **Amazon SQS:**
   - Receives event notifications sent by S3 when objects are created in the bucket.
5. **Background Worker (`worker/worker.js`):**
   - Continuously polls SQS using the SDK client.
   - Upon receiving notifications, parses metadata to set the record state in Oracle DB to `completed`.
6. **Active Image Redirection Flow:**
   - When a client requests `GET /images/:user_id`, the Express API queries the `active` table in the database and sends an HTTP `302 Redirect` to direct the client browser directly to the image object stored in S3 (or custom CDN).

## Concurrency & Scaling Model

- **Competing Consumers:** The worker processes can scale horizontally. Multiple instances of the worker can run concurrently.
- **Visibility Timeout:** AWS SQS manages delivery and guarantees that a message picked up by one worker process is locked and hidden from other workers, preventing duplicate processing.
